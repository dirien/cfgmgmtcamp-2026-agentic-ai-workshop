Welcome to the **Building AI-Assisted Operations: Agentic AI Workshop** repository! This hands-on workshop is part of
[CfgMgmtCamp Ghent 2026](https://cfgmgmtcamp.org/) and will guide you through constructing AI-assisted operational
workflows using Agents supported by MCPs (Model Context Protocols).

## Workshop Details

- **Event:** CfgMgmtCamp 2026 Ghent
- **Date:** February 4, 2026
- **Time:** 09:00–13:00
- **Location:** B.3.0.32

## What You'll Build

In this workshop, you'll create a multi-agent architecture for automating DevOps investigations during deployment
failures. Your AI systems will:

- Monitor different operational areas (infrastructure, deployments, version control)
- Independently identify configuration inconsistencies across Kubernetes environments
- Coordinate information across ArgoCD sync issues and infrastructure code changes
- Integrate with GitHub to review commits and create fix proposals
- Require human validation before executing sensitive operations
